## Overview

Gimlé's memory system provides persistent context that survives across sessions and enables long-term learning.

## Memory Types

### Conversation Memory

Short-term memory that stores recent messages:

```yaml
memory:
  conversation:
    max_messages: 100
    max_tokens: 8000
```

### Long-term Memory

Persistent storage for important information:

```yaml
memory:
  long_term:
    enabled: true
    storage: sqlite
```

### Semantic Memory

Vector-based search for relevant context:

```yaml
memory:
  semantic:
    enabled: true
    provider: pinecone
```

## Memory Compaction

When conversations get long, Gimlé automatically summarizes:

1. **Recency Buffer** - Recent messages kept in full
2. **Summarization** - Older messages compressed
3. **Key Facts** - Important details preserved

## Memory Injection

Before each response, relevant memories are injected:

```yaml
memory:
  injection:
    enabled: true
    max_memories: 5
```

## Querying Memory

```bash
gimli memory search "project deadline"
```

## Clearing Memory

```bash
# Clear conversation memory
gimli memory clear --conversation

# Clear all memory
gimli memory clear --all
```
